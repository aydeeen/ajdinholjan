CSS continues to introduce features that make styling web applications more intuitive and efficient. One such feature is the `accent-color` property, which provides a simple way to customize the appearance of form elements while maintaining consistency across your UI. 

Before `accent-color`, developers had to use complex workarounds involving custom elements or JavaScript to achieve consistent theming. Now, with a single line of CSS, you can control the accent color of form controls like checkboxes, radio buttons, and progress bars.

## What is `accent-color`?

The `accent-color` property allows developers to set a theme color for certain form elements without overriding their default styles. This means you can maintain usability and accessibility while achieving a custom look that aligns with your brand.

### Supported Elements:
- Checkboxes
- Radio buttons
- Range sliders
- Progress bars

These elements traditionally inherit their appearance from the user's operating system or browser styles, making them difficult to customize uniformly. With `accent-color`, you can now easily match them to your site's theme.
